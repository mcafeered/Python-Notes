use .split() to split a string into a list ex. string.split(defines what the string is plit by like .)
use ''.join() (the '' (code for nothing) signifies what the operand joins the value in () with) 

use .input() to prompt for the user to type something which is then turned into a string that can be set as a variable ex. string = input("type sumtin")

use ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= to check if things are equivalent and/or true
use *in* to check for values inside a list

use if statements to check if a condition is true or not ex. if <condition>: along with elif and else, the interpreter goes down the code from top to bottom
use int(), float(), and str() to turn user inputs into integers, floats and strings respectively, must reassign variables to permanently convert them 
use *and*(both/all conditions met), *or*(any of the conditions met) to add extra conditions to if elif statements

run stuff using ./ or python3, follow either with the file

Basic script values

#!/bin/usr/python3 

chmod either 755 or +x to give permissions for execution

ls -l to check permissions

a = whatever - int
a = 'whatever' - string
a = whatever.whatever - float
a / b - division
a // b - integer division
a * b - multiplication
a ** b - exponents
a % b - modulus
int(a) - turn float or string into int
a = [1,2,3] - list
a[2] - index in list
a[-1] - last in list

Basic user input script with example of .format
  1 #!/usr/bin/python3
  2 
  3 user_input = input("what is your username? ")
  4 
  5 print("Hello {} welcome to Bikini Bottom" .format(user_input))

First exercise using .split to extract info from an email address (myattempt)
  1 #!/usr/bin/python3
  2 
  3 user_email = input("Please enter your email address:")
  4 usr_split = user_email.split("@")
  5 usr_name = usr_split[0].split(".")
  6 usr_firstName = usr_name[0]
  7 
  8 print("Good Morning {}, Welcome to {}".format(usr_firstName,usr_split[1]))
alternatively use domain = user_email.split("@")[1]    and 
firstname = user_email.split("@")[0].split('.')[0] for max efficiency

First real exercise using modulus to find divisibility and print certain strings if true (my attempt)
  1 #!/usr/bin/env python3
  2 
  3 userNum = input("Please enter a number: ")
  4 userNum = int(userNum)
  5 
  6 if userNum % 3 == 0 and userNum % 5 == 0:
  7     print("fizzbuzz")
  8 
  9 elif userNum % 3 == 0:
 10     print("fizz")
 11 
 12 elif userNum % 5 == 0:
 13     print("buzz")
 14 
 15 else:
 16     print(userNum)

Another exercise prompting the user for temp and a conversion type (my attempt)
  1 #!usr/bin/python3
  2 
  3 Temp = float(input("What temperature # would you like to convert? "))
  4 Degree = input("Convert your number Celsius or Fahrenheit? ")
  5 
  6 if Degree == "C" or Degree == "Celsius" or Degree == "celsius" or Degree == "c":
  7     Temp = (Temp - 32) * (5/9)
  8 
  9 elif Degree == "F" or Degree == "Fahrenheit" or Degree == "fahrenheit" or Degree == "f":
 10     Temp = (Temp * 1.8) + 32
 11 
 12 else:
 13     print("Incorrect Format")
 14 
 15 print("Your conversion is {}".format(Temp))

A script used to have the user guess a number and make sure it is a real number between 0 and 100 while also giving higher or lower answers for incorrect answers
  1 #!usr/bin/python3
  2 
  3 Correct = 23
  4 
  5 while True: 
  6     guess = input("Guess a number between 0 and 100: ") 
  7     if guess.isnumeric() == True:
  8         guess = float(guess)
  9         if guess > 100 or guess < 0:
 10             print("Enter an integer between 0 and 100")
 11         else:
 12             if guess == Correct:
 13                 print("WIN")
 14                 break
 15             elif guess > Correct:
 16                 print("Too high")
 17             else:
 18                 print("Too low")
 19     
 20     else:
 21         print("Please enter a positive integer")
 
 An example of how to iterate through lists and change values while adding them back into the list or creating a new list
  1 #!/usr/bin/env python3
  2 
  3 def invert(l):
  4     p = 0
  5     for i in l:
  6         l[p] = str(255 - int(i))
  7         p += 1
  8     return l 
  9     
 10 def inverted(l):
 11     NewList = []
 12     for i in l:
 13         NewList.append(str(255 - int(i)))
 14     return NewList

The following scripts were used on RuneAcademy to solve various with open('<txt.file>', '<permission>') as <fileVar> format

this script finds the total number of characters in a file
with open('travel_plans.txt', 'r')as myfile:
    num = len(myfile.read())

this script finds the total number of words in a file
with open('emotion_words.txt', 'r')as myfile:
    num_words = len(myfile.read().split())

this script finds the total amount of sentences in a file
with open('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    num_lines = len(myfile.readlines())

this script gets the first 30 characters of the file and saves them
with open('school_prompt.txt', 'r')as myfile:
    beginning_chars = myfile.read(30)

this script get the third word of every line in a file
three = []

with open('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as myfile:
        lines = myfile.readlines()
        for i in lines:
            three.append(i.split()[2])

this script gets each p character in the file and adds it to a file
p_words = []

with open('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    char = myfile.read().split()
    for i in char:
        if 'p' in i:
            p_words.append(i)

this script encodes a character into preset image values 
  3 def steg_encode_char(char, cover):
  4     charBin = format(ord(char), '0>8b')
  5     for i in range(0,8):
  6         coverBinL = list(format(int(cover[i]), '0>8b'))
  7         coverBinL[-1] = charBin[i]
  8         cover[i] = str(int(''.join(coverBinL), 2))
